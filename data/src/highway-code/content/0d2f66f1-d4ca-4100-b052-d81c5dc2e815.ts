Try to avoid braking so harshly that you lock your wheels. Locked wheels can lead to loss of control.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule119\">Rule 119</h3>\n<p><strong>Skids</strong>. Skidding is usually caused by the driver braking, accelerating or steering too harshly or driving too fast for the road conditions. If skidding occurs, remove the cause by releasing the brake pedal fully or easing off the accelerator. Turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid. For example, if the rear of the vehicle skids to the right, steer immediately to the right to recover.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/highway-code/the-highway-code-rule-119.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<figcaption>Rule 119: Rear of the car skids to the right.

However, in the case of an emergency, apply the footbrake firmly; do not release the pressure until the vehicle has slowed to the desired speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained, but do not assume that a vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter distance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule121\">Rule 121</h3>\n<p><strong>Brakes affected by water.</strong> If you have driven through deep water your brakes may be less effective. Test them at the first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal to make sure that they work. If they are not fully effective, gently apply light pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule122\">Rule 122</h3>\n<p><strong>Coasting.</strong> This term describes a vehicle travelling in neutral or with the clutch pressed down. It can reduce driver control because</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>engine braking is eliminated</li>\n  <li>vehicle speed downhill will increase quickly</li>\n  <li>increased use of the footbrake can reduce its effectiveness</li>\n  <li>steering response will be affected, particularly on bends and corners</li>\n  <li>it may be more difficult to select the appropriate gear when needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule123\">Rule 123</h3>\n<p><strong>The driver and the environment.</strong> You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is likely to remain so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off the engine to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is stationary in traffic or for diagnosing faults.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Law <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/98/made\"><abbr title=\"Road Vehicles (Construction &amp; Use) Regulations\">CUR</abbr> regs 98</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/107/made\">107</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule124\">Rule 124</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> exceed the maximum speed limits for the road and for your vehicle (see the table below).

In England and Wales, the driver <strong>MUST NOT</strong> smoke or allow anyone to smoke in an enclosed private vehicle carrying someone under 18, including motor caravans. In Scotland it is an offence for anyone aged 18 or over to smoke in a private motor vehicle (unless it is parked and being used as living accommodation) when there is someone under 18 in the vehicle and the vehicle is in a public place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laws <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/765/contents/made\"><abbr title=\"Smoke-free (Exemptions and Vehicles) Regulations\">TSf(EV)R</abbr></a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2007/787/contents/made\"><abbr title=\"Smoke-free Premises etc (Wales) Regulations\">TSfP(W)R</abbr></a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2006/90/contents/made\"><abbr title=\"Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Premises (Scotland) Regulations\">TPSCP(S)R</abbr></a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2015/9780111126004/contents\"><abbr title=\"Smoke-free (Private Vehicles) Regulations\">S-f(PV)R</abbr></a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2015/1363/made\"><abbr title=\"Smoke-free Premises etc (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations\">S-f(W)R</abbr></a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/3/contents\">SP(CIMV)(S)A</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones-and-in-vehicle-technology\">Mobile phones and in-vehicle technology</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule149\">Rule 149</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use a hand-held mobile phone, or similar device, capable of interactive communication (such as a tablet) for any purpose when driving or when supervising a learner driver. This ban covers all use of a hand-held interactive communication device and it applies even when the interactive communication capability is turned off or unavailable.

Your vehicle <strong>MUST</strong> be stationary, and the goods or services <strong>MUST</strong> be received at the same time as, or after, the contactless payment.</p>\n\n<p>Never use a hand-held microphone when driving. Using hands-free equipment is also likely to distract your attention from the road.
