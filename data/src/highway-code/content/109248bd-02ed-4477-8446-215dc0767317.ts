The exceptions are when you want to overtake, turn right or pass parked vehicles or pedestrians in the road</li>\n  <li>keep well to the left on right-hand bends. This will improve your view of the road and help avoid the risk of colliding with traffic approaching from the opposite direction</li>\n  <li>drive or ride with both hands on the wheel or handlebars where possible. This will help you to remain in full control of the vehicle at all times. You may use driver assistance systems while you are driving. Make sure you use any system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>\n  <li>be aware of other road users, especially cycles and motorcycles who may be filtering through the traffic. These are more difficult to see than larger vehicles and their riders are particularly vulnerable. Give them plenty of room, especially if you are driving a long vehicle or towing a trailer. You should give way to cyclists when you are changing direction or lane – do not cut across them.</li>\n  <li>select a lower gear before you reach a long downhill slope. This will help to control your speed</li>\n  <li>when towing, remember the extra length will affect overtaking and manoeuvring. The extra weight will also affect the braking and acceleration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule161\">Rule 161</h3>\n<p><strong>Mirrors.</strong> All mirrors should be used effectively throughout your journey. You should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use your mirrors frequently so that you always know what is behind and to each side of you</li>\n  <li>use them in good time before you signal or change direction or speed</li>\n  <li>be aware that mirrors do not cover all areas and there will be blind spots.\nYou will need to look round and check.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors – Signal – Manoeuvre</strong></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"overtaking-rules-162-to-169\">Overtaking (rules 162 to 169)</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule162\">Rule 162</h3>\n<p><strong>Before overtaking</strong> you should make sure</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the road is sufficiently clear ahead</li>\n  <li>road users are not beginning to overtake you</li>\n  <li>there is a suitable gap in front of the road user you plan to overtake.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule163\">Rule 163</h3>\n<p><strong>Overtake only</strong> when it is safe and legal to do so. You should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not get too close to the vehicle you intend to overtake</li>\n  <li>use your mirrors, signal when it is safe to do so, take a quick sideways glance if necessary into the blind spot area and then start to move out</li>\n  <li>not assume that you can simply follow a vehicle ahead which is overtaking; there may only be enough room for one vehicle</li>\n  <li>move quickly past the vehicle you are overtaking, once you have started to overtake. Allow plenty of room. Move back to the left as soon as you can but do not cut in</li>\n  <li>take extra care at night and in poor visibility when it is harder to judge speed and distance</li>\n  <li>give way to oncoming vehicles before passing parked vehicles or other obstructions on your side of the road</li>\n  <li>only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling to turn right, and there is room to do so</li>\n  <li>stay in your lane if traffic is moving slowly in queues. If the queue on your right is moving more slowly than you are, you may pass on the left. Cyclists may pass slower moving or stationary traffic on their right or left and should proceed with caution as the driver may not be able to see you. Be careful about doing so, particularly on the approach to junctions, and especially when deciding whether it is safe to pass lorries or other large vehicles.</li>\n  <li>give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders and horse drawn vehicles at least as much room as you would when overtaking a car (see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/road-users-requiring-extra-care-204-to-225#motorcyclists-and-cyclists-rules-211-to-213\">Rules 211 to 215</a>). As a guide:\n    <ul>\n      <li>leave at least 1.5 metres when overtaking cyclists at speeds of up to 30mph, and give them more space when overtaking at higher speeds</li>\n      <li>pass horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles at speeds under 10 mph and allow at least 2 metres of space</li>\n      <li>allow at least 2 metres of space and keep to a low speed when passing a pedestrian who is walking in the road (for example, where there is no pavement)</li>\n      <li>take extra care and give more space when overtaking motorcyclists, cyclists, horse riders, horse drawn vehicles and pedestrians in bad weather (including high winds) and at night</li>\n      <li>you should wait behind the motorcyclist, cyclist, horse rider, horse drawn vehicle or pedestrian and not overtake if it is unsafe or not possible to meet these clearances.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Remember: Mirrors – Signal – Manoeuvre</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/highway-code/the-highway-code-rule-163.jpg\" alt=\"Rule 163: Give vulnerable road users at least as much space as you would a car\"></p>\n<figcaption>Rule 163: Give vulnerable road users at least as much space as you would a car</figcaption>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule164\">Rule 164</h3>\n<p><strong>Large vehicles.</strong> Overtaking these is more difficult. You should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>drop back. This will increase your ability to see ahead and should allow the driver of the large vehicle to see you in their mirrors. Getting too close to large vehicles, including agricultural vehicles such as a tractor with a trailer or other fixed equipment, will obscure your view of the road ahead and there may be another slow-moving vehicle in front</li>\n  <li>make sure that you have enough room to complete your overtaking manoeuvre before committing yourself. It takes longer to pass a large vehicle. If in doubt do not overtake</li>\n  <li>not assume you can follow a vehicle ahead which is overtaking a long vehicle. If a problem develops, they may abort overtaking and pull back in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/highway-code/the-highway-code-rule-164.jpg\" alt=\"Rule 164: Do not cut in too quickly\"></p>\n<figcaption>Rule 164: Do not cut in too quickly</figcaption>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule165\">Rule 165</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> overtake</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line nearest to you (but see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/general-rules-techniques-and-advice-for-all-drivers-and-riders-103-to-158#rule129\">Rule 129</a>)</li>\n  <li>if you would have to enter an area designed to divide traffic, if it is surrounded by a solid white line</li>\n  <li>the nearest vehicle to a pedestrian crossing, especially when it has stopped to let pedestrians cross</li>\n  <li>if you would have to enter a lane reserved for buses, trams or cycles during its hours of operation</li>\n  <li>after a ‘No Overtaking’ sign and until you pass a sign cancelling the restriction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Laws <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/36\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Act\">RTA</abbr> 1988 sect 36</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/schedule/1/made\"><abbr title=\"Traffic Signs Regulations &amp; General Directions\">TSRGD</abbr> schedule 1</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/schedule/9/made\">schedule 9 part 7</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/schedule/14/made\">schedule 14 part 1</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule166\">Rule 166</h3>\n<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> overtake if there is any doubt, or where you cannot see far enough ahead to be sure it is safe.

Never obstruct drivers who wish to pass. Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is overtaking you is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone overtakes and pulls into the gap in front of you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule169\">Rule 169</h3>\n<p>Do not hold up a long queue of traffic, especially if you are driving a large or slow-moving vehicle. Check your mirrors frequently, and if necessary, pull in where it is safe and let traffic pass.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"road-junctions-rules-170-to-183\">Road junctions (rules 170 to 183)</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule170\">Rule 170</h3>\n<p>Take extra care at junctions.
