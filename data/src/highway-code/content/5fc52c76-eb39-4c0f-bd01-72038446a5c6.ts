If you have to stop on the roadside:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not park facing against the traffic flow</li>\n  <li>stop as close as you can to the side</li>\n  <li>do not stop too close to a vehicle displaying a Blue Badge: remember, the occupant may need more room to get in or out</li>\n  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> switch off the engine, headlights and fog lights</li>\n  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> apply the handbrake before leaving the vehicle</li>\n  <li>you <strong>MUST</strong> ensure you do not hit anyone when you open your door. Check for cyclists or other traffic by looking all around and using your mirrors</li>\n  <li>where you are able to do so, you should open the door using your hand on the opposite side to the door you are opening; for example, use your left hand to open a door on your right-hand side. This will make you turn your head to look over your shoulder. You are then more likely to avoid causing injury to cyclists or motorcyclists passing you on the road, or to people on the pavement</li>\n  <li>it is safer for your passengers (especially children) to get out of the vehicle on the side next to the kerb</li>\n  <li>put all valuables out of sight and make sure your vehicle is secure</li>\n  <li>lock your vehicle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before using a hand-held device to help you to park, you <strong>MUST</strong> make sure it is safe to do so. Then, you should move the vehicle into the parking space in the safest way, and by the shortest route possible.</p>\n\n<p>When you use a hand-held device to help you to park, you <strong>MUST</strong> remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Do not use the hand-held device for anything else while you are using it to help you park, and do not put anyone in danger. Use the hand-held device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n\n<p>When using an electric vehicle charge point, you should park close to the charge point and avoid creating a trip hazard for pedestrians from trailing cables. Display a warning sign if you can. After using the charge point, you should return charging cables and connectors neatly to minimise the danger to pedestrians and avoid creating an obstacle for other road users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laws <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/98/made\"><abbr title=\"Road Vehicles (Construction &amp; Use) Regulations\">CUR</abbr> regs 98</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/105/made\">105</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/107/made\">107</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/592/regulation/2/made#f00003\">110</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1796/regulation/27/made\"><abbr title=\"Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations\">RVLR</abbr> reg 27</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/42\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Act\">RTA</abbr> 1988 sect 42</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/559d2d61e5274a1559000021/the-highway-code-rule-239.jpg\" alt=\"Rule 239: Check before opening your door\"></p>\n<figcaption>Rule 239: Check before opening your door</figcaption>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule240\">Rule 240</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> stop or park on</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the carriageway, an emergency area or a hard shoulder of a motorway except in an emergency (see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/motorways-253-to-273#rule270\">Rules 270</a> and <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/motorways-253-to-273#rule271\">271</a>)</li>\n  <li>a pedestrian crossing, including the area marked by the zig-zag lines (see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/using-the-road-159-to-203#rule191\">Rule 191</a>)</li>\n  <li>a clearway (see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs\">Traffic signs</a>)</li>\n  <li>taxi bays as indicated by upright signs and markings</li>\n  <li>an urban clearway within its hours of operation, except to pick up or set down passengers (see <a href=\"/guidance/the-highway-code/traffic-signs\">Traffic signs</a>)</li>\n  <li>a road marked with double white lines, even when a broken white line is on your side of the road, except to pick up or set down passengers, or to load or unload goods</li>\n  <li>a tram or cycle lane during its period of operation</li>\n  <li>a cycle track</li>\n  <li>red lines, in the case of specially designated ‘red routes’, unless otherwise indicated by signs.
