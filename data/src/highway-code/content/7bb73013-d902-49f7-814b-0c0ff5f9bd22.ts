Some councils offer national standard cycle training such as Bikeability and in certain areas, this is free of charge. It can help build up your skills and confidence.</p>\n\n<p>There are three levels to Bikeability, starting with the basics of balancing, stopping and starting safely, through to handling complex and busy junctions. You will also learn about traffic signs and the rules of the road, planning routes, safe road positioning and signalling (particularly at junctions) and basic cycle maintenance. For more information, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bikeability.org.uk\">www.bikeability.org.uk</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cycling.scot\">www.cycling.scot</a>.</p>\n\n",
