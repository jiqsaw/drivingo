Approach and cross it with care. Never drive onto a crossing until the road is clear on the other side and do not get too close to the car in front. Never stop or park on, or near, a crossing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule292\">Rule 292</h3>\n<p><strong>Overhead electric lines.</strong> It is dangerous to touch overhead electric lines. You <strong>MUST</strong> obey the safe height warning road signs and you should not continue forward onto the railway if your vehicle touches any height barrier or bells.

You <strong>MUST</strong> obey any sign instructing you to use the railway telephone to obtain permission to cross. You <strong>MUST</strong> also telephone when clear of the crossing if requested to do so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laws <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/36\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Act\">RTA</abbr> 1988 sect 36</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/3113/schedule/9/made\"><abbr title=\"Traffic Signs Regulations &amp; General Directions\">TSRGD</abbr> schedule 9 parts 7 and 8</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule295\">Rule 295</h3>\n<p><strong>Crossings without traffic lights.</strong> Vehicles should stop and wait at the barrier or gate when it begins to close and not cross until the barrier or gate opens.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule296\">Rule 296</h3>\n<p><strong>User-operated gates or barriers.</strong> Some crossings have ‘Stop’ signs and small red and green lights. You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> cross when the red light is showing, only cross if the green light is on. If crossing with a vehicle, you should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>open the gates or barriers on both sides of the crossing</li>\n  <li>check that the green light is still on and cross quickly</li>\n  <li>close the gates or barriers when you are clear of the crossing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Laws <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/42/section/55\">TWA 1992 sect 55</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1786/contents/made\">PC(SB)R 1996</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule297\">Rule 297</h3>\n<p>If there are no lights, follow the procedure in <a href=\"#rule296\">Rule 296</a>. Stop, look both ways and listen before you cross. If there is a railway telephone, always use it to contact the signal operator to make sure it is safe to cross. Inform the signal operator again when you are clear of the crossing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule298\">Rule 298</h3>\n<p><strong>Open crossings.</strong> These have no gates, barriers, attendant or traffic lights but will have a ‘Give Way’ sign. You should look both ways, listen and make sure there is no train coming before you cross.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule299\">Rule 299</h3>\n<p><strong>Incidents and breakdowns.</strong> If your vehicle breaks down, or if you have an incident on a crossing you should</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get everyone out of the vehicle and clear of the crossing immediately</li>\n  <li>use a railway telephone if available to tell the signal operator. Follow the instructions you are given</li>\n  <li>move the vehicle clear of the crossing if there is time before a train arrives. If the alarm sounds, or the amber light comes on, leave the vehicle and get clear of the crossing immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"tramways-rules-300-to-307\">Tramways (rules 300 to 307)</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule300\">Rule 300</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> enter a road, lane or other route reserved for trams. Take extra care where trams run along the road. You should avoid driving directly on top of the rails and should take care where trams leave the main carriageway to enter the reserved route, to ensure you do not follow them. The width taken up by trams is often shown by tram lanes marked by white lines, yellow dots or by a different type of road surface. Diamond-shaped signs and white light signals give instructions to tram drivers only.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Law <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/5\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Regulation Act\">RTRA</abbr> sects 5</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/8\">8</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule301\">Rule 301</h3>\n<p>Take extra care where the track crosses from one side of the road to the other and where the road narrows and the tracks come close to the kerb. Tram drivers usually have their own traffic signals and may be permitted to move when you are not. Always give way to trams. Do not try to race or overtake them or pass them on the inside, unless they are at tram stops or stopped by tram signals and there is a designated tram lane for you to pass.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule302\">Rule 302</h3>\n<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> park your vehicle where it would get in the way of trams or where it would force other drivers to do so. Do not stop on any part of a tram track, except in a designated bay where this has been provided alongside and clear of the track. When doing so, ensure that all parts of your vehicle are outside the delineated tram path. Remember that a tram cannot steer round an obstruction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Law <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/5\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Regulation Act\">RTRA</abbr> sects 5</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/8\">8</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule303\">Rule 303</h3>\n<p><strong>Tram stops</strong>. Where the tram stops at a platform, either in the middle or at the side of the road, you <strong>MUST</strong> follow the route shown by the road signs and markings. At stops without platforms you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive between a tram and the left-hand kerb when a tram has stopped to pick up passengers. If there is no alternative route signed, do not overtake the tram - wait until it moves off.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Law <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/5\"><abbr title=\"Road Traffic Regulation Act\">RTRA</abbr> sects 5</a> &amp; <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/section/8\">8</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule304\">Rule 304</h3>\n<p>Look out for pedestrians, especially children, running to catch a tram approaching a stop.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule305\">Rule 305</h3>\n<p>Always give priority to trams, especially when they signal to pull away from stops, unless it would be unsafe to do so. Remember that they may be carrying large numbers of standing passengers who could be injured if the tram had to make an emergency stop. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule306\">Rule 306</h3>\n<p>All road users, but particularly cyclists and motorcyclists, should take extra care when driving or riding close to or crossing the tracks, especially if the rails are wet. You should take particular care when crossing the rails at shallow angles, on bends and at junctions. It is safest to cross the tracks directly at right angles. Other road users should be aware that cyclists and motorcyclists may need more space to cross the tracks safely.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rule307\">Rule 307</h3>\n<p><strong>Overhead electric lines.</strong> Tramway overhead wires are normally 5.8 metres above any carriageway, but can be lower. You should ensure that you have sufficient clearance between the wire and your vehicle (including any load you are carrying) before driving under an overhead wire. Drivers of vehicles with extending cranes, booms, tipping apparatus or other types of variable height equipment should ensure that the equipment is fully lowered. Where overhead wires are set lower than 5.8 metres, these will be indicated by height clearance markings - similar to ‘low bridge’ signs. The height clearances on these plates should be carefully noted and observed. If you are in any doubt as to whether your vehicle will pass safely under the wires, you should always contact the local police or the tramway operator. Never take a chance as this can be extremely hazardous.</p>\n\n",
