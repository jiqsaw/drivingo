Safe driving requires constant focus and attention. Continuously scan your surroundings and evaluate the evolving traffic conditions. Always be aware of traffic around you. Before performing any maneuver like moving off, stopping, turning, or changing lanes, you should:
•Use your mirrors to evaluate how your actions will impact traffic behind you.
•Look around for a final check – windscreen pillars can obstruct your view.
•Signal if necessary.
When reversing and unable to see behind, ask a trustworthy person to guide you. If your view is blocked by parked cars when emerging from a junction, move forward slowly and carefully until you have a clear view. Be extra cautious when overtaking. Ensure:
•You have a clear view of the road ahead with no bends or dips.
•You have enough time to complete the maneuver safely.
It’s important for other road users to be aware of your presence. When it gets dark, switch on your lights even if street lights are not on. In places where visibility is limited, like at a hump bridge, consider using your horn.
