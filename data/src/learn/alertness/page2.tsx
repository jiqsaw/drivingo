Observe road signs and markings as they provide information about potential hazards. You should:
•Follow their guidance.
•Slow down if necessary.
Pay attention to other road users and anticipate their actions to be ready to slow down or change direction if needed. When turning right onto a dual carriageway, first ensure that the central reservation is wide enough for your vehicle.
When following a large vehicle, maintain a safe distance. If you can’t see the vehicle’s mirrors, the driver likely can’t see you either. Keeping a distance also helps you see the road ahead more clearly. Be mindful of more vulnerable road users such as:
•Pedestrians, especially those who may be hidden or approaching a crossing.
•Cyclists; always pass them slowly and leave ample space.
•Motorcyclists, who may be obscured by your windscreen pillar.
If approaching traffic lights that have been green for some time, be prepared to stop as they might change. Regardless of your preparedness, you may need to stop quickly in an emergency. Keep both hands on the wheel to maintain control while braking.
