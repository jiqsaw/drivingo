Plan your journey to ensure you:
•Know the route you need to take.
•Have regular rest stops.
You won’t be able to concentrate if you're tired. It’s especially easy to feel drowsy on motorways, particularly at night. Therefore:
•Avoid driving continuously for more than 2 hours.
•Keep fresh air circulating in the car.
•If you start to feel drowsy, exit at the next opportunity, find a safe and legal place to stop, and take a break.
Self-reflection: It's tempting to keep driving despite fatigue. Planning rest breaks along your route will help keep you alert and ensure you arrive safely. Remember: driving while tired triples the risk of being involved in a collision or near-miss.
