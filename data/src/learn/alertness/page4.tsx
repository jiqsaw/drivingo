const title = `Distraction and boredom`;
const content = `
Do not let passengers distract you. Arguments or jokes can divert your attention from driving. Loud music can also impair your concentration and make it hard to hear sounds outside the car, potentially causing you to miss hazards.
You may also be distracted by:
•Objects hanging in the car.
•Starting or adjusting music or radio.
•Looking at a map.
•Speaking into a microphone.
Just taking your eyes off the road for a second can be disastrous. At 60 mph (96 km/h), your car travels 27 meters in that time. Using a mobile phone while driving is illegal and greatly increases the risk of a collision. Be safe: switch your phone off or set it to voicemail. Use your phone only when legally parked in a safe place to:
•Retrieve messages.
•Make calls.
•Send or receive texts.
•Go online.
On a motorway, exit and stop in a safe place before using your phone. If your vehicle has a navigation system, stop in a safe place before programming it. If you get lost on a busy road, turn into a side road, stop, and check the map.
