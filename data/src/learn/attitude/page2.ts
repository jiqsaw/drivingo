Be mindful of other road users. Cyclists, horse riders, and other types of vehicles have as much right to use the road as you do. Avoid competitive driving as it increases risks for everyone. Horses can easily be startled, causing the rider to lose control. When passing them:
•Reduce your speed.
•Allow ample space. Exercise caution if there are animals like sheep on the road. Stop and turn off your engine if needed or if asked to do so. If you’re driving a slow-moving vehicle, consider those behind you. If there’s a long queue:
•Pull over safely when you can.
•Let the traffic pass. Be thoughtful. Consider how you would feel if you were one of the drivers behind. They might not be as patient as you are. Assist other road users by signaling correctly and positioning yourself properly at junctions or in one-way systems. For instance, if you intend to turn right, move into the right-hand lane. An improperly positioned vehicle can hinder those behind you.
