const title = `Consideration`;
const content = `
Be considerate to other road users. Other types
of vehicle, cyclists and horse riders have just as
much right to use the road as you. Do not drive in
a competitive way – people who do this cause an
increased risk for everyone on the road.
Horses become frightened easily and the rider
could lose control. When passing them
• keep your speed down
• give them plenty of room.
Take care if there are animals, such as sheep, on
the road. Stop and switch off your engine if
necessary or if you're asked to do so.
If you're driving a slow-moving vehicle, consider
the other drivers behind you. If there's a long
queue
• pull over as soon as you can do so safely
• let the traffic pass.
Try to be considerate. Think how you would feel
if you were one of the drivers behind you. They
may not be as patient as you are.
Help other road users by signalling correctly and
taking up the correct position at junctions or in
one-way systems. For instance, if you want to
turn right, get into the right-hand lane. A badly
positioned vehicle could prevent vehicles behind
proceeding.
