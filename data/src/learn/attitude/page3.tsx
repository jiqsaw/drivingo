Maintain a safe following distance:
•In dry conditions, keep a two-second gap.
•In wet conditions, increase this to four seconds.
Tailgating is:
•Extremely dangerous.
•Intimidating for the driver ahead.
Keep a safe distance, especially from large vehicles, to improve your view of the road and anticipate hazards. If someone is tailgating you, gradually slow down to increase the gap between you and the vehicle in front. If another driver cuts in front, fall back to restore your safety margin.
