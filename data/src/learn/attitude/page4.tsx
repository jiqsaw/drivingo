Exercise patience with other road users. Not everyone follows the rules, so stay calm and tolerant. For instance, if a vehicle pulls out in front of you, slow down and avoid getting annoyed. Reflect on past instances when driving made you impatient. Did you consider doing something risky? Think about how your friends and family would feel if your driving caused a serious incident—is it worth the risk? Use your horn only in cases of danger. At night, avoid dazzling other drivers by dipping your headlights when:
•Following another vehicle.
•Meeting oncoming traffic.
When queuing in traffic at night, use your parking brake to avoid dazzling drivers behind you.
