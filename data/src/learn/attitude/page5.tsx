Give priority to emergency vehicles—they need to move quickly to save lives. Safely pull over to let them pass. Besides fire, police, and ambulance services, other vehicles using blue flashing lights include:
•Coastguard
•Bomb disposal
•Mountain rescue
•Blood transfusion
Doctors may use green flashing lights when responding to emergency calls. Give way to buses pulling out from stops if it’s safe. Be aware of bus lanes in operation and avoid using them. At unmarked crossroads, no one has priority—slow down and look both ways. Be mindful of pedestrians at zebra crossings:
•Slow down and be ready to stop.
•Be patient if they cross slowly.
•Don’t wave them on; there might be another vehicle.
Some zebra crossings have a lane for cyclists. Give way to cyclists as you would to pedestrians. At pelican crossings with a flashing amber light:
•Give way to pedestrians.
•Don’t move until the crossing is clear.
Puffin crossings use sensors to manage pedestrian flow and can extend crossing time for those needing extra assistance. Toucan crossings allow both cyclists and pedestrians to cross simultaneously.
