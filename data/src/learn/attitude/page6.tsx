I've seen this sign - what does it mean?
This sign is for trams only. Even if trams aren’t common where you live, it’s crucial to know how to handle them in cities where they operate. Give cyclists and motorcyclists extra space near tram rails, as they can be slippery and difficult to navigate.
Why do large vehicles 'hog' the road?
Large vehicles need more room to maneuver, especially when approaching junctions and making turns. Stay back and avoid trying to pass them on the left, as the rear of the vehicle may swing out.
A large vehicle is trying to overtake me but is taking a long time; what should I do?
Slow down and allow them to pass. They require more time to overtake compared to smaller cars.
What do I do if I'm traveling at the speed limit and a driver comes up behind flashing their headlights or trying to overtake?
Maintain a steady course and let them overtake. Don’t attempt to block them, as they may become more frustrated.
I'm never too sure when I should flash my headlights.
Flash your headlights only to alert other road users of your presence. It’s not a signal for priority, impatience, or greeting others.
Why is diesel fuel particularly dangerous when spilled?
It’s slippery. Be cautious when refueling, as there may be spilled fuel near the pump. Fuel on your shoes can cause slipping on the pedals. Ensure the fuel cap is securely fastened after refueling to prevent spills.
