The vehicle registration certificate (V5C) provides information about:
•The vehicle's make, model, and engine size.
•The registered keeper.
As the registered keeper, you must inform the licensing authority if:
•You change your vehicle.
•Your name or permanent address changes.
For second-hand vehicle purchases, immediately notify the licensing authority of the ownership change. All motor vehicles used or kept on public roads must have paid vehicle tax unless exempt. If the vehicle will be off public roads, notify DVLA in advance for a Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN), effective until you tax, sell, or scrap it.
Learners must have a valid provisional driving licence before driving on public roads. Notify the licensing authority if:
•Health conditions might affect your driving.
•Your eyesight does not meet the necessary standards.
