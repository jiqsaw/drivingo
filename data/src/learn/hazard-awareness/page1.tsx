As you begin learning to drive, your focus will be on mastering the car’s basic controls. As your skills develop, you’ll become better at recognizing hazards on the road. A hazard is any situation that may require you to take action, such as braking or steering. Hazards include:
Static hazards: parked cars, roundabouts, and junctions.
Moving hazards: other road users.
Road and weather conditions.
Personal factors: if you are not alert or fit to drive.
