Various static hazards include bends, junctions, roundabouts, parked vehicles, roadworks, traffic calming measures, crossings, and traffic lights. These may require you to respond by:
Noting their presence.
Slowing down and being ready to stop if necessary.
Road signs and markings provide important information. Learn their meanings and watch for them to reduce speed and prepare for necessary actions. The same applies to traffic lights, other signals, level crossings, and police signals. Treat out-of-order traffic lights as unmarked crossroads, proceeding with caution.
If you see a bend sign, consider what might be around the bend. Can you stop safely in time? Parked cars, especially when illegally parked, can also pose a hazard. Be vigilant for:
Children darting out from between cars.
Car doors opening.
Cars moving off.
Near schools, look out for flashing amber lights indicating children may be crossing or using a school crossing patrol. Slow down and be ready to stop if necessary.
Junctions often have reduced visibility, especially in built-up areas. Approach slowly until you can see clearly. Reflections in shop windows can help you see oncoming traffic. Donâ€™t block junctions; leave them clear for other vehicles to enter and exit.
Where lanes are closed, be prepared for cars cutting in front of you and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. On two-way roads with a central third lane, traffic from both directions may use it for overtaking.
On motorways or dual carriageways, briefly use your hazard warning lights to alert traffic behind you of hazards or obstructions. If your vehicle breaks down and causes an obstruction, use your hazard warning lights to warn other road users.
