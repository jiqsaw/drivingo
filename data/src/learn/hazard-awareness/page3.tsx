const content = `
Be vigilant for other road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, large vehicles, slow-moving vehicles, motorcyclists, and disabled people using powered vehicles.
In built-up areas, be patient with pedestrians crossing the road. On country roads, watch for pedestrians walking on the road, possibly towards you on your side. Give cyclists ample space as they may swerve to avoid obstacles. At junctions and traffic lights, allow cyclists time to turn or pull away. Check for cyclists filtering on your left before turning left.
If you see a bus at a stop, be cautious as passengers may cross the road and the bus may move off. School buses might stop in places other than bus stops. High vehicles may use the center of the road at some bridges to pass underneath.
Watch for vehicles, especially motorcyclists, overtaking and cutting in front of you. Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Be patient with older drivers who may react slower. Learn the meanings of information signs on the back of certain vehicles, like road maintenance vehicles, heavy goods vehicles over 13 meters long, and vehicles carrying hazardous chemicals.
Do not overtake:
If you're turning left soon afterward.
Where signs and road markings prohibit it.
When approaching a junction.
When the view ahead is obstructed.
