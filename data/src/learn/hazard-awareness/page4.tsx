Avoid becoming a hazard on the road. Stay alert at all times and use your mirrors to be aware of your surroundings. Convex mirrors can provide a wider field of vision. Do not drive if you’re tired; plan your journey with sufficient rest and refreshment breaks, stopping at least once every two hours. Ensure good ventilation by keeping windows open.
If you feel tired:
Pull over at a safe and legal place to rest.
On a motorway, leave at the next exit or services.
Your concentration can be affected by:
Using a hands-free phone headset.
Listening to loud music.
Looking at navigation equipment.
Your emotional state.
Self-reflection: Turn off your phone and store it in the glove compartment before driving. Ask passengers to confirm it's stored out of reach. Using a handheld phone while driving can result in 6 penalty points and a £200 fine, and you'll lose your license if you passed your test within the last two years.
Calm down after an argument before continuing your journey. Never drive if you’ve consumed alcohol; it’s not worth the risk. Use public transport if you’ve been drinking. Stick to non-alcoholic drinks if you drive to social events.
Alcohol:
Reduces concentration, coordination, and control.
Creates a false sense of confidence.
Impairs judgment of speed.
Slows reaction times.
Ensure you’re fit to drive. Some medications can cause drowsiness; check with a doctor or pharmacist if it’s safe to drive. Never drive under the influence of illegal drugs, as their effects can last up to 72 hours. A conviction for driving unfit due to drink or drugs will significantly increase your insurance costs.
Your eyesight should meet safe standards. Wear glasses if needed every time you drive and never drive without them. Avoid tinted glasses at night. Inform the licensing authority if:
Your eyesight deteriorates.
You suffer from an illness that may affect your driving.
