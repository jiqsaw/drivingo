How do I deal with inconsiderate drivers?
Drivers sometimes make mistakes or misjudgments. Stay calm and do not react aggressively. Waiting patiently may allow the other driver to move out of the way. Take a break if you feel upset. Good anticipation can prevent minor incidents from escalating.
How do you prevent the car behind from driving too closely?
Move over to let the car through if possible. If thereâ€™s no room, increase your distance from the car in front to lessen the risk of a road traffic incident.
Why are two-way roads divided into three lanes more dangerous?
Traffic from both directions may use the middle lane for overtaking, potentially leading to collisions.
What should I do if a car is about to reverse out in front of me?
Reduce your speed and be ready to stop. Use your horn to alert them or flash your headlights if it's between 11:30 PM and 7 AM.
What should I do if I take the wrong route and find myself on a one-way street?
Do not turn around. Continue to the end of the road and find a safe place to turn around.
What should I do if it looks like the driver in front has forgotten to cancel their right indicator?
Stay cautious and do not overtake; they may be unsure about the junction's position and turn suddenly.
