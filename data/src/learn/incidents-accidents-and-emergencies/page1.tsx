If a warning light appears on your vehicle's instrument panel while driving, stop as soon as safely possible to investigate the issue.

If you experience a tyre burst or puncture while driving:

Hold the steering wheel firmly.

Slowly pull up or roll to a stop at the roadside.

If you break down on the motorway, try to reach the next exit or service area. If this isn't possible, move to the left-hand lane and steer your vehicle into an emergency area or onto the hard shoulder as safely as possible.

On the hard shoulder, stop just beyond an emergency phone and as far left as possible, away from traffic. Leave enough space to exit the vehicle using the nearside door.

If you cannot exit your vehicle, call 999 immediately and request the police. Alternatively, use your vehicle's SOS button if available and ask for the police.

If you have mobility difficulties, remain in your vehicle with your seatbelt fastened, switch on hazard warning lights, and call 999 for the police.
