You must have at least third-party insurance before driving on public roads. This insurance covers:
•Injuries to other people.
•Damage to others' property.
•Damage to other vehicles.
Driving without insurance is illegal and can result in an unlimited fine or disqualification. Provide your insurance certificate when taxing your vehicle or if requested by a police officer. You may initially receive a temporary cover note until the insurance certificate is issued.
Before driving another person’s vehicle, confirm that it is insured for your use. Insurance costs depend on various factors but are generally lower if you:
•Are over 25 years old.
•Complete the Pass Plus scheme (not available in Northern Ireland).
Insurance policies may include an excess, e.g., £100, meaning you'll pay the first £100 of any damage claim. The Pass Plus scheme can help newly qualified drivers improve skills and potentially reduce insurance costs.
