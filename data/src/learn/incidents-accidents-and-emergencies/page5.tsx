Even without first aid knowledge, you can assist injured individuals by:

Calling emergency services on 999 or 112.

Keeping them warm and comfortable.

Talking to them calmly and reassuringly.

Ensuring they are not left alone.

Do not move them unless in immediate danger, and then with extreme care. If a motorcyclist is involved, never remove their helmet unless necessary to keep them alive.

Do not offer food, drink, or cigarettes to casualties.

If a casualty is unconscious, ensure they can breathe normally. If so, place them in the recovery position until help arrives, regularly checking their airway remains clear.

Follow the DR ABC code for emergency care:

Danger: Ensure it is safe to approach.

Response: Try to get a response by gently shaking their shoulders and asking, “Are you alright?” If they respond, check for injuries.

Airway: If no response, open their airway by lifting their chin forward.

Breathing: Check for normal breathing by looking for chest movement and feeling breath on your cheek. If no signs, start CPR, pressing down hard and fast in the center of the chest.

Circulation: If responsive and breathing, check for bleeding and apply pressure or padding around the wound without removing embedded objects.

People may suffer shock, indicated by a rapid pulse, sweating, and pale grey skin. Reassure them, keep them warm, make them comfortable, and avoid moving them unless necessary.

For burns, cool the area with water for at least 20 minutes without removing anything stuck to the burn.

Consider taking first aid training from a qualified organisation.
