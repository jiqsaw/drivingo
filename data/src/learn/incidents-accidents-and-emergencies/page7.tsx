What should I do if I see something fall from a lorry on the motorway?

Stop at the next emergency telephone and report the hazard to the police. Do the same if anything falls from your vehicle â€“ do not attempt to retrieve it yourself.

What should I do if my engine catches fire?

Pull over as safely and quickly as possible. Evacuate all passengers and move away from the vehicle before calling the fire service. Do not open the bonnet, as it can worsen the fire.

What items should I carry in my car for emergencies?

It's useful to have a first aid kit, a warning triangle, and a fire extinguisher. These items can be invaluable in preventing or reducing injuries.

What should I do if I smell petrol?

Stop and investigate as soon as it's safe to do so. Do not ignore it. Carrying a fire extinguisher may help tackle a small fire, but do not take unnecessary risks.
