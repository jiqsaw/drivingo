When merging onto the motorway from a slip road:
Adjust your speed to match the traffic already on the motorway.
Always yield to traffic already on the motorway.
Once on the motorway, stay in the left-hand lane until you become accustomed to the higher speeds of motorway traffic.
All traffic should use the left-hand lane unless overtaking, regardless of the speed. Use the middle and right-hand lanes solely for overtaking.
When overtaking:
Normally, overtake on the right.
You may overtake on the left if traffic is moving slowly in queues and the queue on your right is moving more slowly than your lane.
On steep uphill gradients, a separate lane for slow-moving vehicles may be provided to facilitate smoother traffic flow.
If you are in the left-hand lane and traffic is joining from a slip road, move to another lane if possible to help traffic merge, especially during peak times.
Countdown markers on the left-hand verge indicate the approach of the next exit. If you intend to leave the motorway, get into the left-hand lane well in advance. If you miss your exit, continue to the next oneâ€”never stop or reverse.
