Traffic management aims to reduce congestion and make journey times more reliable. Where in use, mandatory speed limit signs will appear on gantries to help maintain a steady traffic flow, reducing bunching and improving journey times.
Sometimes, the hard shoulder may be used as a normal traffic lane, indicated by a speed-limit sign above all lanes, including the hard shoulder. A red cross above the hard shoulder means it should only be used in an emergency or breakdown.
Emergency areas have been established for use in cases of emergencies or breakdowns. Traffic officers in England and Wales cover motorways and some 'A' class roads and can:
Stop and direct anyone on a motorway or an 'A' road.
Respond to calls made from roadside emergency telephones.
