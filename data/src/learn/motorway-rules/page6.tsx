Only stop on the motorway:
If flashing red lights show above every lane.
When instructed by police or traffic officers.
In a traffic jam.
In an emergency or breakdown.
Follow overhead gantry signals advising you to move over. Only stop on the hard shoulder in emergencies. For other stops, like rest breaks or checking a map, leave at the next exit or go to a service area.
If your vehicle breaks down or you get a puncture, try to reach the hard shoulder and call for help. Use emergency telephones, usually at one-mile intervals with 100-metre marker posts pointing to the nearest phone. These are directly connected to a control centre for appropriate assistance.
When using an emergency phone, stand facing oncoming traffic to see approaching hazards. If using a mobile phone, note your location (nearest marker post number) before calling emergency services.
When ready to rejoin the motorway, drive along the hard shoulder to gain speed and merge into a safe gap. If unable to reach the hard shoulder:
Turn on hazard warning lights.
Exit the vehicle only if safe to do so.
