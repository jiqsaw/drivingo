Can I drive on a motorway with a provisional car or motorcycle licence?
Motorcyclists with provisional licences cannot ride on motorways. Learner drivers may have lessons on motorways but only with an approved driving instructor (ADI) in a dual-control car displaying L plates.
How should I navigate a contraflow system?
Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, adhere to lower speed limits, and stay in your lane as lanes may be narrower and lack permanent barriers from oncoming traffic. Avoid unnecessary lane changes.

The following vehicles are prohibited from motorways:
Bicycles.
Motorcycles under 50 cc.
