Motorcyclists are more affected by windy conditions than other vehicles. They can be blown sideways and veer into your path more easily, so:
Allow extra room when overtaking a motorcyclist.
Keep well back if a motorcyclist in front of you is overtaking a high-sided vehicle, as they could be blown off course.
Watch for signs indicating that the road is susceptible to side winds. Motorcyclists may swerve to avoid uneven or slippery surfaces. Metal drain covers can be particularly hazardous for two-wheeled vehicles in wet weather.
