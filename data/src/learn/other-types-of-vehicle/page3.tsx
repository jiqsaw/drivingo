Large vehicles obstruct your view of the road ahead. Maintain a safe distance when following a large vehicle, especially if you intend to overtake. If another car fills the gap you've left, drop back further. This improves your view and ensures you are more visible.
In wet weather, large vehicles throw up significant spray, affecting visibility. Drop back further until you can see clearly. If spray makes you hard to see:
Use dipped headlights.
Use rear fog lights if visibility is seriously reduced (less than 100 metres or 328 feet).
Overtaking a large vehicle is riskier due to its length, requiring more time to overtake. Only begin overtaking if you can complete the manoeuvre safely.
Stay well back and give large vehicles ample room at:
Road junctions.
Crossroads.
Mini-roundabouts.
To navigate corners, large vehicles may move in the opposite direction to which they are indicating. For example, they may indicate left but move right to make the turn, and vice versa.
If you are waiting to emerge left from a minor road and a large vehicle approaches from the right, wait. The large vehicle could conceal an overtaking vehicle.
