How can I adjust my mirrors to help me see behind when I'm towing a caravan?
Fit extended-arm side mirrors for a better view past the caravan.
If I'm driving downhill and a large vehicle coming uphill needs to move out to pass a parked car, should I stop for it?
Slow down and give way if possible. Itâ€™s much harder for large vehicles to stop and then restart uphill.
Which vehicles are most affected by side winds?
Cyclists, motorcyclists, and high-sided vehicles are more affected by side winds than cars. Be aware they may swerve suddenly and allow extra room when following or overtaking.
Is there a speed limit for powered vehicles used by disabled people?
Powered vehicles used by disabled people, such as wheelchairs and scooters, have a maximum speed limit of 8 mph (12 km/h) when used on the road.
I hope this meets your needs. Let me know if there are further changes you need!
