You must comply with all traffic signs and road markings. Road signs are categorized by shape and color, each indicating different instructions:
Circular signs give orders.
Blue circles provide instructions.
Red circles indicate actions you must not do.
Triangular signs provide warnings.
Rectangular signs offer information.
The "stop" sign is an exception to the shape rule, being octagonal to ensure its meaning is clear even if partially obscured, for example by snow.
Maximum speed limits are shown inside red circles â€“ you must not exceed the indicated speed. National speed limits apply where no specific speed limits are posted. Speed limit signs may also be part of other signs, such as those indicating a traffic-calmed area.
"Know Your Traffic Signs" shows all common signs, while "The Highway Code" contains vital advice and current GB legislation and best practices in road safety. Familiarize yourself with these to avoid breaking the law inadvertently.
