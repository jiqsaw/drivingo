Road markings convey information, orders, or warnings. Generally, more paint means a more important message. Types of road markings include:
Along the middle of the road:
Short broken white lines divide lanes.
Longer broken white lines are hazard warning lines; only overtake if the road ahead is clear.
Double white lines with a solid white line on your side â€“ you must not cross or straddle the line.
White diagonal stripes or chevrons separate lanes or protect turning traffic.
Along the side of the road:
White lines show the edge of the carriageway.
Yellow lines indicate waiting and stopping restrictions.
Zigzag lines (white at pedestrian crossings, yellow outside schools) mean no stopping or parking at any time.
Lines on or across the road:
Broken lines across the road mean "give way."
Solid lines mean "stop."
Various markings (e.g., "give way" triangles, road-hump markings, arrows) warn of hazards.
Refer to "Know Your Traffic Signs" and "The Highway Code" for a comprehensive understanding of road markings. Reflective studs on motorways and other roads are particularly useful at night and in poor visibility.
