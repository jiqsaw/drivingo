Traffic lights and warning lights:
At traffic lights, the sequence and meanings are:
Red: Stop and wait behind the stop line.
Red and amber: Stop and wait.
Green: Go if the way is clear.
Amber: Stop unless you have already crossed the stop line or are too close to stop safely.
Red (again): Same as the first red light.
A green filter arrow means you can go in that direction even if the main light is not green. If traffic lights are out of order, proceed with caution as no one has priority. Look out for signs indicating this issue.
Red flashing lights can be found at level crossings, lifting bridges, or outside fire stations â€“ stop when they show. On motorways, signals on overhead gantries or roadside may be accompanied by flashing lights:
Amber: Warns of a hazard (e.g., fog, lane closures, instruction to leave at the next exit) or a temporary maximum speed limit.
Red flashing lights and a red X: You must not drive in the lane indicated as closed.
Red flashing lights in the central reservation or roadside with a lane closed sign: You must not proceed in any lane. Red flashing lights at a slip road's start mean you must not enter that slip road or join the motorway at that junction.
