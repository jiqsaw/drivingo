Drivers typically signal intentions with indicators. Ensure your indicators are canceled after turning to avoid misleading others. Another driver might accidentally leave their indicator on â€“ for instance, if a driver approaching from the right indicates left, wait until they turn before emerging.
Use arm signals to clarify indicator messages, like when signaling to turn right in busy traffic. Signal when slowing down and stopping just after a junction only when passing or after the junction.
Police may signal while directing traffic; know all arm and police signals. Use the horn to alert others to your presence but never between 11:30 PM and 7 AM. Only use the horn when stationary if another vehicle poses a danger.
Flash your headlights solely to warn others of your presence.
