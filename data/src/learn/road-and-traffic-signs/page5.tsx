A police officer in a patrol vehicle might flash headlights or blue lights, use a siren or horn, and indicate left to get you to stop. Pull over on the left safely as soon as possible.
Traffic officers use amber flashing lights, usually from behind, pointing or indicating left to get you to pull over. They operate in England and Wales, covering motorways and some 'A' class roads.
Failing to comply with directions from police or traffic officers is an offense.
