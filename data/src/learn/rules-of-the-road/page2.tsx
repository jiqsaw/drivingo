You MUST NOT exceed the speed limit for the road youâ€™re on or your vehicle. Where no other limit is shown, the national speed limit for cars and motorcycles is:
60 mph (96 km/h) on a single carriageway road.
70 mph (112 km/h) on a dual carriageway or motorway.
Lower speed limits apply for vehicles towing a trailer or caravan:
50 mph (80 km/h) on a single carriageway road.
60 mph (96 km/h) on a dual carriageway or motorway.
In England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, roads with street lights typically have a 30 mph (48 km/h) speed limit unless signs indicate otherwise. In Wales, the same roads usually have a 20 mph (32 km/h) speed limit.
Some roads may display a minimum speed limit sign. Travel above this limit unless unsafe to do so.
Self-reflection: Do you sometimes exceed the speed limit? Ask your instructor to help you identify correct speed limits and discuss how to maintain an appropriate speed for driving conditions. Remember, the speed limit is the absolute maximum, not necessarily a safe driving speed under all conditions. Always drive carefully and according to the conditions.
When driving on a street with parked cars, keep your speed down and watch for:
Pedestrians (especially children) emerging from behind or between parked vehicles.
Vehicles pulling out.
Drivers' doors opening.
At roadworks, temporary speed limits may be in place to slow traffic. Always obey these signs.
