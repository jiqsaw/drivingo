Certain roads have lanes reserved for specific vehicles like cycles, buses, trams, or motorcycles. These lanes are marked by signs and road markings and should only be used by those vehicles during their hours of operation.
Never drive or park in a cycle lane marked by a solid white line during its operational period. Avoid driving or parking in a broken-line cycle lane unless unavoidable.
Only drive over a footpath to gain access to a property.
On a dual carriageway, the right-hand lane is for turning right or overtaking. This rule also applies to three-lane dual carriageways.
Approach junctions with extra care. Move into the appropriate position in good time. If turning left, keep to the left as you approach the junction and check for cyclists on your left before turning in slow-moving traffic.
When turning right at a crossroads with an oncoming driver also turning right, it is typically safest to keep the other vehicle on your right and turn behind it. If passing in front of the other vehicle, take extra care as your view may be obscured.
