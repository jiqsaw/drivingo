Overtaking can be hazardous. Ensure it is necessary and safe before doing so. Normally overtake on the right, but you may overtake on either side in a one-way street.
Take extra care when overtaking on a dual carriageway, as the right-hand lane is also for traffic turning right.
If you find yourself:
Traveling in the wrong direction.
In the wrong lane at a busy junction.
Continue until you find a safe place, like a quiet side road, to turn around.
Never reverse:
Longer than necessary.
From a side road into a main road.
When reversing into a side road, check traffic and road conditions in all directions. If unsure, get out and check before reversing. The front of your vehicle swinging out poses the greatest hazard to passing traffic.
