Level crossings, where a railway line crosses the road, may have countdown markers to warn you if the crossing is hidden.
If warning lights activate as you approach the crossing, stop.
If on the crossing when lights or bells activate, keep going to clear the crossing.
If waiting at a crossing and a train passes but the red lights continue flashing, wait as another train may be coming.
