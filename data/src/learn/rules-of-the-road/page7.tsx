At night, the safest place to park is in your garage if you have one. If away from home, find a secure car park or park in a well-lit area.
When parking on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph, you MUST leave your sidelights on. Normally, park on the left-hand side so other users can see your reflectors. In one-way streets, you may park on either side.
Never stop on a clearway. On an urban clearway or road with double white lines (even if one line is broken), stop only to set down or pick up passengers.
Avoid parking where it would cause danger or obstruction, such as:
On or near the brow of a hill.
At a bus stop.
Opposite a traffic island.
In front of someone else's drive.
Near a school entrance.
Within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction (15 metres or 48 feet in Northern Ireland).
Do not obstruct by stopping or parking where restrictions such as yellow lines and signs apply. In controlled parking zones, you must pay to park. Park within marked bays on the indicated days and times.
Only park in a disabled space if you or a passenger is a disabled badge holder. Always display the badge when leaving the vehicle.
