It is illegal to smoke in a private enclosed vehicle if one or more occupants is under 18. This means it is an offence:
For anyone to smoke in a vehicle carrying someone under 18.
For a driver, including a provisional driver, not to stop someone smoking if an occupant is under 18.
The rules do not apply to e-cigarettes.
