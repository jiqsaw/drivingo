Regular care and maintenance ensure that your car remains safe and roadworthy. It also helps improve fuel economy and minimizes exhaust emissions. Regularly check the following items:
Lights, brakes, steering, exhaust system, seat belts, horn, speedometer, wipers, and washers – these must all be functioning properly.
Oil and water levels – crucial to check, especially before long journeys (avoid overfilling with oil to prevent leaks).
Brake fluid – low levels are dangerous and could cause incidents.
Battery levels – unless maintenance-free, it may require topping up with distilled water (just above the cell plates).
Windscreen – must be in good condition.
Tyre pressures – check at least once a week when cold for accuracy. Under-inflated tyres can affect steering (feels heavy), fuel consumption (may increase), and braking.
Tyre condition – the tread on car and trailer tyres must be at least 1.6 mm deep across the central three-quarters of the tyre's breadth and around the entire circumference. Driving with tyres that have deep cuts in the side walls is illegal.
Uneven tyre wear can indicate issues with:
Braking system
Suspension
Wheel alignment
Unbalanced wheels may cause the steering to vibrate.
