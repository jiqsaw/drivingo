Having a basic understanding of how your car works can help you recognize signs of defects. It’s vital that your car is regularly checked by a qualified mechanic, especially the brakes and steering.
Dashboard warning lights indicate engine performance and any faults:
Check your vehicle handbook for meanings.
Do not ignore warnings as they could impact your safety.
The ABS warning light should turn off when the vehicle reaches 5 to 10 mph (8 to 16 km/h). If not, have it checked by a qualified mechanic.
To check shock absorber condition, "bounce" the vehicle by pushing down hard over each wheel; it should rebound no more than once when released.
Consult a garage if:
The steering vibrates – wheel balancing may be needed.
The vehicle pulls to one side when braking – brakes may need adjusting.
