Modern cars are equipped with safety features designed to protect occupants. Always wear your seat belt and ensure passengers do too (unless exempt). The driver is responsible for ensuring children under 14 wear appropriate restraints. If no child restraint is available in the rear seat, an adult seat belt MUST be used.
Never fit a rear-facing baby seat in a seat with an active airbag, as it can cause fatal injuries. The airbag MUST be deactivated first.
Self-reflection: Not wearing a seat belt can have severe consequences for yourself, passengers, and other road users. Have you ever driven without a seat belt? How would you feel if you injured someone in a traffic incident? Remember, you could be fined up to Â£500 for not wearing a seat belt.
When getting into the car:
Adjust the seat to reach all controls comfortably.
Adjust the head restraint to prevent neck injury in a collision.
Wear suitable shoes for controlling the pedals.
Adjust mirrors to maximize your field of vision. Convex mirrors provide a wider view but may make vehicles appear farther away. If reversing without a clear view, get assistance.
Use dipped headlights in poor visibility to ensure other road users can see you. Use fog lights in thick fog.
When parking on a two-way road at night, park facing the traffic direction. If the speed limit exceeds 30 mph, switch on parking lights.
Use hazard warning lights to warn drivers of hazards ahead, such as:
When broken down.
Queuing traffic on dual carriageways or motorways.
Do not use hazard lights to park illegally, even briefly.
