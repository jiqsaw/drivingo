Make your car less attractive to thieves by:
Engaging the steering lock.
Removing the keys and locking the car even for short absences.
Locking contents out of sight or taking them with you.
Not leaving the vehicle registration document in the car.
Parking in well-lit areas or secure car parks at night.
To deter thieves further:
Fit an anti-theft alarm or immobilizer.
Use visible security devices, such as steering-wheel or handbrake locks.
Etch the vehicle registration number on the windows.
Radios and in-car entertainment are prime targets for thieves. Install a security-coded radio if possible. Consider joining a vehicle watch scheme if available in your area.
