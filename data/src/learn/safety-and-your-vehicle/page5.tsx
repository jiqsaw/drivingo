Avoid parking where it obstructs other road users, such as:
In front of property entrances.
At or near bus stops.
Near the brow of a hill.
Where the kerb is lowered for wheelchair access.
On bends or opposite side roads.
Never stop or park on or near level crossings or zigzag lines at pedestrian crossings, as it blocks views and endangers pedestrians.
