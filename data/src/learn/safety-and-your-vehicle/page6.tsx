Motor vehicles harm the environment by causing air pollution and consuming non-renewable resources. Help the environment by driving fuel-efficiently, improving road safety, reducing emissions, and lowering fuel consumption.
You should:
Reduce speed – vehicles at 70 mph use up to 15% more fuel than at 50 mph.
Plan ahead to drive smoothly – avoiding rapid acceleration and heavy braking can cut fuel bills by up to 15%.
Change up gears early to use the highest possible gear without engine struggle, reducing fuel use.
Regularly service and tune your vehicle properly.
Ensure tyres are correctly inflated.
Avoid:
Carrying unnecessary loads or leaving empty roof racks.
Over-revving the engine in lower gears.
Leaving the engine running unnecessarily – switch it off if stationary for more than a few seconds.
You MUST NOT leave your vehicle unattended with the engine running. Switch off the engine and secure the vehicle before leaving it. Switch off the engine when waiting for passengers.
Avoid making many short car journeys; consider walking or cycling instead. Using public transport or car-sharing reduces traffic and emissions. Modern trams use electric power, reducing traffic and noise pollution.
After refuelling, securely fasten the filler cap to prevent fuel spillage, which wastes fuel and money and makes roads slippery for other users.
Regular vehicle servicing improves fuel economy and reduces exhaust emissions. Vehicles over 3 years old (4 years in Northern Ireland) must pass an emissions test as part of the MOT test.
Dispose of old engine oil and batteries responsibly by taking them to local-authority sites or garages. Do not pour oil down drains.
Be mindful of noise pollution. In built-up areas, MUST NOT use car horns between 11:30 PM and 7 AM, unless another vehicle poses a danger.
High speeds increase breakdown risk. Check your vehicle, especially oil, water, and tyre pressure, before long motorway journeys.
