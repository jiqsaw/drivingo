I've heard the term 'dry steering' â€“ what does this mean?

This is when you turn the steering wheel while the car is not moving. It can cause unnecessary wear to the tyres and steering mechanism.

What is a catalytic converter?

A catalytic converter is a device fitted to the exhaust system. It reduces emissions by acting like a filter, removing some of the toxic waste.

Road humps have been installed in our area. What other types of traffic-calming measures are there?

As well as road humps, road narrowing and chicanes may be used as traffic-calming measures. These are used to slow the traffic down, so keep your speed down throughout the area.


A reduced speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) is
being introduced on many narrow residential
streets. Look out for the signs, and remember the
measures are there for a good reason: they could
save lives.
In an automatic car, what is 'kick-down'?
This is a device that gives quick acceleration
when needed; for example, to overtake.
Excessive use of kick-down will burn more fuel.
On a trip to London I saw red lines on the side
of the road. What are they for?
These indicate 'Red Routes'. They help the traffic
flow by restricting stopping on these routes. They
can now also be found in other cities.
I've heard of 'brake fade'. What does it mean?
This is when the brakes become less effective
because of overheating. It may happen if they're
used continuously, such as on a long, steep,
downhill stretch of road. Using a lower gear will
help braking.
