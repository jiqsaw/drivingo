Self-reflection: Your personal safety margin is the space you maintain around your vehicle. Reflect on your personal safety margin the next time you drive. Are you too close to other vehicles?
Always keep in mind not just your safety but that of your passengers and other road users. Reduce your chances of being involved in a traffic incident by understanding safety margins and the risks of not adhering to them. Never take unnecessary risks. Position your vehicle appropriately (e.g., on bends) to improve your view of the road ahead.
Maintain control of your car by using the correct procedures. For example, when traveling downhill, control your speed by:
Selecting a lower gear.
Braking gently.
Do not "coast" – traveling in neutral or with the clutch disengaged (pressed down) – as this reduces your control over the car.
