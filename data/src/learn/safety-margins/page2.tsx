const title = `Stopping Distances`;
const content = `
Leave enough room between your vehicle and the one in front so you can stop safely if it slows down or stops suddenly. Your overall stopping distance is the distance your car travels:
From the moment you realize you must brake.
To the moment your car stops.
This consists of thinking distance and braking distance.
Study the typical thinking, braking, and stopping distances in The Highway Code. These are based on vehicles traveling:
With good tyres and brakes.
On a dry road.
In good conditions.
Don’t just learn the figures – be able to judge the distance. A useful method is to leave a two-second gap between your vehicle and the one in front.
Increase these distances in different conditions:
When raining or the road is wet – double the distance.
When icy – ten times the distance.
In faster conditions, such as on motorways, increasing the distance between vehicles lowers collision risk.
