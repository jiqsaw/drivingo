Weather conditions significantly affect safety margins. In bad weather, such as snow, ice, or thick fog, consider whether your journey is necessary. Never underestimate the dangers.
Before starting a journey in freezing weather, clear ice and snow from your windows, lights, mirrors, and number plates.
When driving:
Use the highest gear you can.
Brake gently and in plenty of time.
Be prepared to stop and clean snow from your windscreen by hand if wipers cannot keep it clear.
When foggy:
Allow more time for your journey.
Slow down, as visibility is reduced.
Increase the gap between your vehicle and the one in front.
Use dipped headlights even in daylight. If visibility falls below 100 metres (328 feet), use fog lights if you have them. Remember to switch them off when the fog lifts.
In wet conditions, maintain a safe separation distance, especially if another vehicle overtakes and pulls in front of you.
Aquaplaning may occur in heavy rain. Tyres lift off the road surface and skate on a water film, making the steering light. On ice, tyres make hardly any noise. If this happens:
Ease off the accelerator.
Do not brake until your steering feels normal again.
After driving through deep water, such as a ford or flood, test your brakes. If necessary, dry them out by pressing lightly on the brake pedal as you go along.
Hot weather can also pose dangers. The road surface might become soft, and tyres might not grip well, affecting:
Braking.
Steering.
Bright sunlight can dazzle drivers, making indicators hard to see. Consider giving an arm signal as well.
High winds can blow you off course, especially on open roads. They have a greater effect on high-sided vehicles, motorcyclists, and cyclists. Be cautious when passing these road users, as they may be blown off course by sudden gusts. Allow extra room and check your left side as you pass them.
