Skidding is mainly caused by the driver. Adjust your driving to the road, weather, and traffic conditions. The risk of skidding is greatest in wet or icy conditions. Black ice is not obvious until you feel the steering become light. Be aware that in very cold weather, it could be a hazard.
Reduce the risk of skidding and wheelspin by driving:
At a low speed.
In the highest gear possible.
Scan the road ahead for clues such as signs and markings to avoid surprises. You can:
Slow down gradually before reaching a hazard, like a bend.
Avoid sudden steering movements.
If you start to skid:
Release the footbrake and reapply it gently.
Steer smoothly in the direction of the skid – if the back of the car skids right, steer right, and vice versa.
Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) reduce skidding risk in emergencies. Wheel speed sensors anticipate when a wheel is about to lock. If driving a vehicle with ABS:
Apply the footbrake rapidly and firmly.
Do not release the brake pedal until stopped.
ABS may not reduce stopping distance but allows steering while braking as wheels don't lock. It may not work effectively on:
Surface water.
Loose road surfaces.
Electronic stability control (ESC), also known as Electronic Stability Program (ESP®), combines ABS and traction control functions to prevent sideways skidding. ESC detects skid risk early and intervenes with selective braking to restore stability. It's now fitted to all new UK cars.
