Why does my instructor tell me to keep well to the left before a right-hand bend?
Keeping to the left improves your view of the road ahead and gives an earlier indication of hazards.
How can I park safely on a downhill slope?
Apply the parking brake firmly and turn the steering wheel towards the kerb to help prevent the vehicle from rolling downhill.
What are the benefits of a four-wheel-drive vehicle?
Improved road holding and extra grip help on slippery or uneven roads.
I know overtaking is dangerous. Are there places I should avoid?
Ensure you have enough time to complete the manoeuvre safely. Do not overtake:
Where your view ahead is blocked (e.g., by a bend).
When approaching a junction.
If you intend to turn off the road shortly after.
Why are there so many speed humps?
Speed humps are traffic-calming measures usually found in built-up areas to enhance safety. Slow down as you approach and drive over them.
