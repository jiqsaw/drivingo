Rain or Wet Conditions
When it’s raining or the road is wet, maintain at least double the normal stopping distance. If you’re following a vehicle at a safe distance and another vehicle pulls into the gap, drop back to regain a safe distance. On wet roads, be cautious of motorcyclists, who may suddenly change direction to avoid slippery drain covers.
If daytime visibility is poor, use dipped headlights to help other road users see you. If visibility becomes seriously reduced (cannot see more than about 100 metres or 328 feet), you MUST use dipped headlights.
In winter, fords are more likely to flood, making them difficult to cross. Depth gauges can help decide if you should proceed. If you decide to go through:
Use a low gear.
Drive through slowly.
Test your brakes afterwards as wet brakes are less effective.
