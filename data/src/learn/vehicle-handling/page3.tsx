Ensure your headlights do not dazzle:
The vehicle you’re following.
Oncoming traffic.
Other road users.
If you’re dazzled by an oncoming vehicle’s headlights, slow down or stop to maintain control. Be extra cautious when overtaking at night, as you cannot see as far ahead and there may be bends in the road.
On a motorway, use:
Dipped headlights, even if the road is well-lit.
Sidelights if you’ve broken down and are parked on the hard shoulder to help other road users see you.
