Keep full control of your vehicle at all times. Driving with the clutch down or in neutral (coasting) reduces control, particularly of steering and braking, which is especially dangerous when traveling downhill as the vehicle will gain speed quickly without engine braking.
Use your vehicle’s engine to help control your speed. Select a lower gear when driving down a steep hill to prevent brakes from overheating and becoming less effective.
When driving up a steep hill, the engine will work harder and you’ll slow down sooner.
Take extra care on single-track roads. If you see an oncoming vehicle, pull into or opposite a passing place.
Always drive according to conditions. Your stopping distance will be affected by:
Your speed.
Tyre condition.
The weather.
Avoid skidding, as regaining control can be challenging. If you do not have anti-lock brakes (ABS) and your vehicle begins to skid when braking on a wet road, first release the footbrake. If the rear wheels begin to skid, steer into the skid by turning the steering wheel in the same direction. Avoid sudden or harsh braking, as it worsens the situation.
