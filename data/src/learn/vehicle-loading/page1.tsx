You are responsible for ensuring your vehicle is not overloaded. Overloading can significantly affect handling, especially steering and braking. Distribute any load evenly.
Securely fasten any load on a roof rack. A heavy load will reduce vehicle stability.
When carrying or towing a heavy load, you may need to adjust tyre pressures and headlight aim.
Ensure the load does not obstruct your view or stick out where it could endanger other road users.
