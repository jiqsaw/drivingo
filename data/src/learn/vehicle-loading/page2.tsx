All passengers MUST wear seat belts if fitted. The driver is responsible for ensuring all children (under 14 years) wear appropriate restraints. The type of restraint varies with the child's age but MUST be suitable for the child's weight and size.
Under no circumstances should a passenger travel in a caravan while being towed. Animals should be restrained to avoid distraction or obstructing the driver's view.
