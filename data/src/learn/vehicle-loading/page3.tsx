If you passed your car driving test after January 1, 1997, you are restricted to towing trailers up to 3,500 kg maximum authorised mass (MAM). If towing a caravan, a stabiliser fitted to your tow bar can improve handling, especially in windy conditions.
Your caravan or trailer must have a secondary coupling device, typically a chain or cable. If the main coupling fails, the secondary coupling keeps the trailer connected to the towing vehicle.
If a trailer or caravan starts to swerve or snake, ease off the accelerator and gradually reduce speed to regain control.
There are lower national speed limits for vehicles towing trailers:
Dual carriageways or motorways: 60 mph (96 km/h). In England, Scotland, and Wales, on motorways with more than 2 lanes, you MUST NOT drive in the right-hand lane.
Single carriageways: 50 mph (80 km/h).
