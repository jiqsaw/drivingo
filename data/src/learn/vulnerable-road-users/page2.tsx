Pedestrians typically use pavements or footpaths. Take extra care if they have to walk on the road due to:
Pavement closures from street repairs.
Country roads with no pavement.
On country roads, pedestrians are advised to walk on the right side, facing oncoming traffic. Signs may warn of people walking on the road.
A large group, such as an organized walk, may walk on the left side. At night, designated individuals at the front and rear of the group should carry bright lights – white at the front, red at the rear – to warn approaching vehicles.
Watch for pedestrians already crossing when you turn into a side road. They have priority, so wait for them to cross.
Be ready to slow down and stop at pedestrian crossings:
Zebra crossings: Slow down and prepare to stop if someone is waiting to cross.
Pelican crossings: Light-controlled. During the flashing amber phase, give way to pedestrians on the crossing. If the lights change to green while someone is still crossing, be patient and wait until they finish crossing.
Puffin crossings: Sensors detect pedestrians on the crossing. Lights remain red until the crossing is clear.
Toucan crossings: Cyclists can cross with pedestrians. No flashing amber phase.
