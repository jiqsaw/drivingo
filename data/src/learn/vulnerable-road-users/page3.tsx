Children are particularly vulnerable as road users because they can be unpredictable and less likely to look before stepping into the road.
Drive carefully near schools:
Flashing amber lights under a school warning sign indicate reduced speed until clear of the area.
Be prepared for a school crossing patrol to stop traffic with a stop sign.
Do not wait or park on yellow zigzag lines outside a school to ensure clear visibility for:
Drivers on the road.
Pedestrians on the pavement.
Buses and coaches carrying schoolchildren display a special sign indicating frequent stops, not just at bus stops.
