Be cautious if older people are about to cross the road ahead, as they may misjudge your speed. If they are crossing, be patient and allow them to cross safely.
Treat disabled pedestrians with the same respect but be patient as they may need extra time to cross.
A pedestrian with hearing difficulties may have a dog with a distinctive yellow or burgundy coat. A person carrying a white stick with a red band or walking with a dog wearing a red-and-white checked harness is both deaf and blind. Take extra care as they may not be aware of approaching vehicles.
