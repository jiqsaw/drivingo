Cyclists should follow the same rules as drivers but are slower and more vulnerable. Signs may indicate special cycle routes or shared cycle and pedestrian routes.
Advanced stop lines allow cyclists to position themselves in front of traffic. When the lights are red or about to turn red, stop at the first white line.
When overtaking a cyclist, give them as much room as a car. They may swerve to:
Avoid a drain or uneven road surface.
Counter wind effects.
Cyclists going slowly or glancing over their shoulders may be planning to turn right. Stay behind and give them ample space.
Never overtake a cyclist (or moped) just before turning left. Hold back and wait until they pass the junction.
When emerging from a junction, look carefully for cyclists as they are less visible than larger vehicles. Also, watch for cyclists emerging from junctions.
At roundabouts, be aware that cyclists may stay in the left-hand lane regardless of their direction. Hold back and give them plenty of room.
