Many of the points for cyclists also apply to motorcyclists. Leave extra room when following or overtaking a motorcycle and look for signs they may turn right. Look carefully for them at junctions as they are smaller and harder to see.
In traffic queues, be aware that motorcyclists may:
Filter between lanes.
Cut in just in front of you.
Pass very close to you.
Before turning right, always check for other traffic, especially motorcyclists, who may be overtaking.
If unsure about a slow-moving motorcyclistâ€™s intentions, stay behind in case they change direction suddenly.
To improve visibility, motorcyclists often wear bright clothing and ride with dipped headlights, even during the day. They also wear safety gear like helmets. If a motorcyclist is injured in an accident, seek medical assistance and do not remove their helmet unless essential.
