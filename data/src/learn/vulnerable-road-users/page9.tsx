Reversing seems dangerous. How can I ensure it's safe?
Always check behind the car carefully, especially for children who are hard to see. If unsure, get out and check. Stop and give way to pedestrians crossing behind you.
What should I do if parked vehicles restrict my view when emerging from a junction?
Stop, then creep forward slowly until you have a clear view.
How can I tell if someone is going to cross the road between parked cars?
You can't be sure, but look for signs like a ball bouncing into the road or a bicycle wheel sticking out between cars. Slow down and be ready to stop.
What does a flashing amber beacon on a vehicle mean?
It indicates a slow-moving vehicle. A powered vehicle used by a disabled person MUST have a flashing amber light when traveling on a dual carriageway.
Why be careful if a bus stops on the other side of the road?
Pedestrians may cross from behind the bus or dash across from your left.
If I have a collision, whatâ€™s the first thing I must do?
Stop. By law, you MUST stop if damage or injury occurs to any person, vehicle, animal, or property.
What can I do if I'm dazzled by the vehicle behind?
Set your interior mirror to anti-dazzle if possible. Slow down and stop if you cannot see.
