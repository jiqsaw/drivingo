        questionCode: 'adi2005',
        content: `If you wish to overtake a long vehicle, stay well back so that you can see the road ahead. Don't\n• get too close to the vehicle, as this will restrict your view of the road ahead\n• get impatient; overtaking on a busy road calls for sound judgement\n• take a gamble; only overtake when you can see that you can safely complete the manoeuvre.`,

        questionCode: 'adi2006',
        content: `At a crossroads where there are no 'give way' signs or road markings, no-one has priority, even if the roads are of different sizes. Approach slowly and only cross when the junction is clear.`,

        questionCode: 'adi2008',
        content: `If you're following a large vehicle but are so close to it that you can't see its exterior mirrors, the driver can't see you.\nKeeping well back will also allow you to see the road ahead by looking past either side of the large vehicle.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2013',
        content: `To check whether you've left a safe gap between your vehicle and the one ahead, choose a fixed reference point such as a bridge, sign or tree. When the vehicle in front passes the object, say to yourself, 'Only a fool breaks the two-second rule'. If you reach the object before you finish saying this, you're too close.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2014',
        content: `Following the vehicle in front too closely is called 'tailgating'. It's very dangerous because it restricts your view of the road ahead. Also, it leaves you no safety margin if the vehicle in front slows down or stops suddenly.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2015',
        content: `Keeping a safe distance behind a large vehicle will increase your view of the road ahead and allow the other driver to see you in their mirrors. This will help you both to see, and act safely on, any hazards that might occur.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2016',
        content: `Wet roads will reduce your tyres' grip on the road. The safe separation gap of at least two seconds in dry conditions should be doubled in wet weather.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2017',
        content: `It can be worrying if the driver behind hasn't left enough room to stop if you have to brake hard - for example, in an emergency. Driving defensively, you should give yourself a greater safety margin by easing back from the vehicle in front. If an emergency arises, you'll be able to slow down more gradually, giving the driver behind more time to respond.`,

    {
        questionCode: 'adi2023',
        content: `The wheels of a bicycle can become stuck in tram rails, causing the cyclist to stop suddenly, wobble or fall off. Tram rails also offer less grip than the road surface. This could cause a cyclist to skid, especially when it's wet.`,
    },

        questionCode: 'adi2024',
        content: `You mustn't use a vehicle's horn between 11.30 pm and 7.00 am in a built-up area or when the vehicle is stationary, unless another moving vehicle poses a danger. The horn should be used to alert other road users to your presence.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2025',
        content: `If you're travelling in a one-way street and wish to turn right, you should take up a position in the right-hand lane. This will enable other road users not wishing to turn to keep going on the left. Indicate your intention and take up your position in good time.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2026',
        content: `If you wish to turn right into a side road, take up your position in good time. When it's safe to do so, you should position just left of the centre of the road. This will allow following vehicles to pass you on the left. Early positioning will show other traffic what you intend to do.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2036',
        content: `In windy conditions, care must be taken on open, exposed roads. A strong gust of wind can blow you off course. Watch out for other road users who may be worse affected. These include cyclists, motorcyclists, and drivers of high-sided lorries or vehicles towing trailers.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2037',
        content: `You should always give cyclists plenty of room when you're overtaking them. When it's windy, you need to allow enough room in case a sudden gust blows them off course and into your path.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2038',
        content: `Signals should be cancelled soon after use. If a driver is unsure of the location of a junction or destination, they may signal earlier than normal while looking for their turn. Don't attempt to overtake, as they may turn suddenly.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2043',
        content: `At blind junctions, there's often a 'stop' sign. The 'stop' sign has been put there because the view into the main road is poor. You must stop because it won't be possible to assess the situation on the move, however slowly you're travelling.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2044',
        content: `If a driver makes a mistake and emerges from a side road into your path, you should show tolerance and not react aggressively. If you're shaken or upset by the experience, slow down and - if necessary - stop in a convenient place. Take a break until you can safely continue on your journey.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2046',
        content: `If you're turning into a side road, pedestrians already crossing the road have priority and you should give way to them. Don't\n• wave them across the road\n• sound your horn\n• flash your headlights\n• give any other misleading signal - other road users may misinterpret your signal and you might lead the pedestrian into a dangerous situation. \nIf a pedestrian is slow or indecisive, be patient and wait. Don't hurry them across by revving your engine.`,

    {
        questionCode: 'adi2051',
        content: `Be aware that elderly people might take a long time to cross the road. They might also be hard of hearing and not hear you approaching. Don't hurry elderly people across the road by getting too close to them or revving your engine.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2053',
        content: `If you're following a cyclist who's signalling to turn right at a roundabout, leave plenty of room. Give them space and time to get into the correct lane.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2054',
        content: `Cyclists and motorcyclists are smaller than other vehicles and so are more difficult to see. They can easily be hidden from your view by cars parked near a junction.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2055',
        content: `If you're waiting to emerge from a side road, watch out for motorcycles. They're narrower than cars and can be difficult to see. Be especially careful if there are parked vehicles restricting your view. A motorcycle might be approaching. If you don't know, don't go.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2056',
        content: `A motorcycle can be lost from sight behind another vehicle. The use of the headlight helps to make it more conspicuous and therefore more easily seen.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2058',
        content: `When a vehicle is travelling slowly, the driver or rider is probably looking for a turning or entrance. Be patient and stay behind them. They're quite likely to change direction or stop, suddenly and without signalling.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2059',
        content: `If you see a motorcyclist take a quick glance over their shoulder, this could mean they're about to change direction. Recognising a clue like this helps you to be prepared and take appropriate action, making you safer on the road.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2062',
        content: `Horse riders often keep to the outside of the roundabout even if they're turning right. Give them plenty of room and remember that they may have to cross lanes of traffic.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2064',
        content: `Motorcyclists will be checking the road ahead for uneven or slippery surfaces, especially in wet weather. They may need to move across their lane to avoid road-surface hazards such as potholes and slippery metal drain covers.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2065',
        content: `Large vehicles can hide other vehicles that are overtaking, especially motorcycles. You need to be aware of the possibility of hidden vehicles and not assume that it's safe to emerge.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2066',
        content: `A long vehicle, such as a lorry, a coach or a vehicle towing a trailer, may swing out to the right as it approaches a left turn. This allows the rear wheels to clear the kerb. Don't try to filter through if you see a gap on the nearside.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2067',
        content: `When a long vehicle is going to turn right, it may need to keep close to the left-hand kerb. This is to prevent the rear wheels from cutting the corner as it turns. You need to be aware of how long vehicles behave in these situations. Don't try to overtake, as the vehicle could turn while you're alongside. Stay behind and wait for it to complete the turn.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2069',
        content: `It takes more time to overtake a long vehicle than a small one, such as a car. Before overtaking, you need to be able to see far enough ahead to know that you have the space and time to complete the manoeuvre safely.\nHazards to watch for include oncoming traffic, junctions, bends or dips (which could restrict your view), and any signs or road markings prohibiting overtaking.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2073',
        content: `If you intend to overtake on a two-way road that has three lanes, you must consider that approaching traffic could be planning the same manoeuvre. When you've considered the situation and have decided it's safe, indicate your intentions early. This will show the approaching traffic that you intend to pull out. Some of these roads have solid white lines marked to allow for overtaking in one direction only, usually for uphill traffic.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2074',
        content: `Wet weather will affect the time it takes for you to stop. If another vehicle pulls into the gap you've left, ease back until you've regained the stopping distance that's appropriate for the conditions.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2077',
        content: `On a two-way road, you may only park at night without lights switched on if\n• the road has a speed limit of 30 mph or less \n• you're at least 10 metres (32 feet) away from a junction\n• you're facing in the direction of the traffic flow.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2080',
        content: `Once you've joined a motorway, you need to stay in the left-hand lane for long enough to give yourself time to judge, and adjust to, the speed of motorway traffic.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2081',
        content: `You normally join a motorway from a slip road on the left. Join where there's a suitable gap in the traffic travelling in the left-hand lane. You should adjust your speed to fit in with the traffic flow in the left-hand lane, but you must give way to the traffic already on the motorway. Don't try to force your way into the traffic stream. \n`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2083',
        content: `On a motorway, all traffic should use the left-hand lane unless they're overtaking. Use the centre or right-hand lanes if you need to overtake.\nMake sure that you move back to the left-hand lane when you've finished overtaking. Don't stay in the middle or right-hand lane if the left-hand lane is free.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2084',
        content: `You should keep to the left and only use the centre or right-hand lanes if you're passing slower-moving traffic.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2086',
        content: `In normal driving, you'll overtake on the right. However, you may overtake on the left if traffic is moving slowly in queues and the traffic on your right is moving more slowly than the traffic in your lane.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2087',
        content: `If you're making a long journey, plan a rest stop of 15 minutes for every two hours of driving. Motorway driving can be very tiring, especially for new drivers, and if you feel tired you'll need to find somewhere safe to stop. However, you mustn't stop on a motorway, hard shoulder or slip road except in an emergency or traffic queue. To find a safe place to stop, you'll need to leave the motorway at the next exit or stop at the next motorway service area.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2088',
        content: `On a motorway, it's best to use a roadside emergency telephone so that the emergency services are able to locate you easily. The nearest telephone is indicated by an arrow on marker posts, which are placed every 100 metres along the edge of the hard shoulder. If you do use a mobile phone, the emergency services will want to know your exact location. Before you call, find out the number on the nearest marker post; this will tell the emergency services your exact location.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2090',
        content: `Use the hard shoulder to gain speed and indicate your intention, but don't force your way into the traffic. Wait for a safe gap in the traffic in the left-hand lane before you rejoin the main carriageway.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2091',
        content: `Where a motorway has a steep uphill gradient, slow-moving, large vehicles might get in the way of other traffic. An extra lane on the left may be provided for these slow-moving vehicles. It allows faster-moving traffic to flow more easily.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2099',
        content: `A 30 mph limit usually applies where there are street lights but no speed-limit signs.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2100',
        content: `Never overtake unless you're absolutely sure that it's safe. Ask yourself, 'Can I see far enough down the road to complete the manoeuvre safely? Are there junctions ahead? Is it legal to overtake here?' If you have any doubt, then wait until you can overtake safely and legally.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2101',
        content: `Long vehicles might have to take a slightly different position when approaching the roundabout or going around it. This is to stop the rear of the vehicle cutting in and mounting the kerb. \nHorse riders and cyclists might stay in the left-hand lane although they're turning right. Be aware of this and allow them room.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2105',
        content: `You should normally use the left-hand lane on any dual carriageway, unless you're overtaking or turning right. \nWhen overtaking on a dual carriageway, look for vehicles ahead that are turning right. They're likely to be slowing or stopped. You need to see them in good time so that you can take appropriate action.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2107',
        content: `Sometimes road markings can be obscured by queuing traffic, or you may be unsure which lane you need to be in. If you realise too late that you're in the wrong lane, don't cut across lanes or bully other drivers to let you in. Follow the lane you're in and find somewhere safe to turn around if you need to.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2108',
        content: `You can overtake other traffic on either side when travelling in a one-way street. Make full use of your mirrors and ensure that it's clear all around before you attempt to overtake. Look for signs and road markings and use the most suitable lane for your destination.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2111',
        content: `A long vehicle may have to straddle lanes on, or approaching, a roundabout. This is to prevent the rear wheels from going up onto the kerb. If you're following a long vehicle, stay well back and give it plenty of room.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2116',
        content: `Once a pedestrian has stepped onto the crossing, you must stop and let them cross. Don't forget to check your mirrors before slowing down. Wait until the pedestrian has finished crossing before you drive on.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2127',
        content: `In a contraflow system, you'll be travelling close to oncoming traffic and sometimes in narrow lanes. You should \n• obey the temporary signs governing speed limits\n• get into the correct lane in good time\n• keep a safe separation distance from the vehicle ahead.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2138',
        content: `You should normally overtake on the right, but there are some occasions when you may overtake on the left. These include when you're driving on a dual carriageway or motorway and the traffic is moving slowly in queues, or when a vehicle ahead is positioned to turn right and there's room to pass on the left. On dual carriageways or motorways, don't overtake on the left if traffic is flowing freely.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2139',
        content: `You should stay in the left-hand lane of a motorway unless overtaking. The right-hand lane of a motorway is an overtaking lane and not a 'fast lane'. After overtaking, move back to the left when it's safe to do so.`,

    {
        questionCode: 'adi2167',
        content: `The hard shoulder of a motorway that's not subject to smart motorway technology is only to be used in an emergency or if you break down. Roadside emergency telephones are placed about one mile apart and they connect directly to a control centre. The control centre will know your exact location from the telephone you're using and will inform the appropriate emergency services for you. Never cross the carriageway to use a telephone on the other side.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2170',

    {
        questionCode: 'adi2181',
        content: `If you're driving along the motorway in the left-hand lane and you see traffic joining from a slip road ahead, you should move to another lane if it's safe to do so. This can greatly assist the flow of traffic joining the motorway, especially at peak times.`,
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'adi2184',
        content: `Traffic-calming measures, such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings, are intended to slow traffic down and to protect vulnerable road users. Maintain a reduced speed until you reach the end of the traffic-calming zone.`,

As soon as you become aware of a possible problem, you should discuss this with your pupil and positively encourage them that, in their interest, and for other road users as well, it would be far better to postpone the appointment. If you can't dissuade them, then you should withhold the use of your vehicle. Ultimately, it's the pupil's test and an instructor can't prevent them from taking it in someone else's vehicle.`,

Learning will also be more effective if the pupil can spot their own errors and come up with their own strategies for ensuring the errors don't happen again.

On motorways, vehicles are travelling at much higher speeds, so they may come up behind you very quickly. By checking the mirrors early, you'll have a chance to plan and give any necessary signals in plenty of time, so that other drivers have advance warning of your intended actions. In turn, they'll have more time to expect a change in traffic pattern and be able to prepare and act accordingly.`,
