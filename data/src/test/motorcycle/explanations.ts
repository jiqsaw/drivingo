    {
        questionCode: 'AA4619',
        content: 'The `lifesaver` is essential to motorcyclists and does exactly what it says: it could save your life. Its purpose is to check the blind spot that isn`t covered by your mirrors. Learn and understand how and when you should use it.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4624',
        content: 'Always concentrate on the road ahead. Try not to be distracted by an incident on the other side of the road. Many motorway collisions occur due to traffic slowing down because drivers are looking at something on the other side of the road.'

    {
        questionCode: 'AB2008',
        content: 'It`s illegal to use a hand-held mobile or similar device when driving or riding, except in a genuine emergency. The safest option is to switch off your mobile phone before you set off, and use a message service. If you`ve forgotten to switch your phone off and it rings, you should leave it. When you`ve stopped in a safe place, you can see who called and return the call if necessary.'

    {
        questionCode: 'AB2702',
        content: 'If you`re following a large vehicle but are so close to it that you can`t see its exterior mirrors, the driver won`t be able to see you. Keeping well back will also allow you to see the road ahead by looking past the large vehicle.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2828',
        content: 'You should be constantly scanning the road for clues about what`s going to happen next. Check your mirrors regularly, particularly as soon as you spot a hazard. What`s happening behind may affect how you respond to hazards ahead.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2829',
        content: 'At junctions, your view is often restricted by buildings, trees or parked cars. You need to be able to see in order to judge a safe gap. Edge forward slowly and keep looking all the time. Don`t cause other road users to change speed or direction as you emerge.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4007',
        content: 'As you approach a zebra crossing, look out for people waiting to cross and be ready to stop. Some pedestrians may be a little slow to understand that it`s safe to cross, so give them time. Be patient and don`t rev your engine or surge forward before the crossing is clear.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4008',
        content: 'You need to be able to see well down the road and be ready for any hazards. Staying too close to the vehicle will reduce your view of the road ahead and the driver of the vehicle in front may not be able to see you either. Without a safe separation gap, you don`t have the time and space you need to react to any hazards.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4010',
        content: 'Animals are easily frightened by moving motor vehicles. If you`re approaching horses, keep your speed down and watch to see if the rider has any difficulty keeping control. Always be ready to stop if necessary. When it`s safe to pass, give them plenty of room.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4542',
        content: 'Try not to hold up a queue of traffic. This might lead to other road users becoming impatient and attempting dangerous manoeuvres. If you`re riding a slow-moving scooter or small motorcycle and a queue of traffic has built up behind you, look for a safe place to pull in so they can pass safely.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4543',
        content: 'Aim to ride in the middle of your lane. Avoid riding in the gutter or in the centre of the road, where you might \n* obstruct overtaking traffic \n* put yourself in danger from oncoming traffic\n* encourage other traffic to overtake you on the left.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4614',
        content: 'Overconfidence, lack of experience and poor judgement can cause a motorcyclist to make poor decisions, which can lead to a collision. It`s just as important to make sure you have the right attitude and self-awareness as a rider as it is to develop skilful riding techniques.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2012',
        content: 'Pelican crossings are signal-controlled crossings operated by pedestrians. Push-button controls change the signals. Pelican crossings have no red-and-amber stage before green; instead, they have a flashing amber light. This means you must give way to pedestrians who are on the crossing but if the crossing is clear you can continue.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2015',
        content: 'If people are waiting to use a pedestrian crossing, slow down and be prepared to stop. Don`t wave them across the road, because another driver may not have seen them, may not have seen your signal, and may not be able to stop safely.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2022',
        content: '`Tailgating` is the term used when a driver or rider follows the vehicle in front too closely. It`s dangerous because it restricts your view of the road ahead and leaves no safety margin if the vehicle in front needs to slow down or stop suddenly. Tailgating is often the underlying cause of rear-end collisions or multiple pile-ups. '
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2023',
        content: 'Staying back will increase your view of the road ahead. This will help you to see any hazards that might occur and give you more time to react.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2025',
        content: 'Water will reduce your tyres` grip on the road. The safe separation gap of at least two seconds in dry conditions should be doubled, to at least four seconds, in wet weather.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2028',
        content: 'A long lorry with a heavy load will need more time to pass you than a car, especially on an uphill stretch of road. Slow down and allow the lorry to pass.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2029',
        content: 'Emergency vehicles use blue flashing lights. If you see or hear one, move out of its way as soon as it`s safe and legal to do so.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2031',
        content: 'Pull over in a place where the ambulance can pass safely. Check that there are no bollards or obstructions in the road that will prevent it from passing.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2033',
        content: 'A green flashing beacon on a vehicle means the driver or passenger is a doctor on an emergency call. Give way to them if it`s safe to do so. Be aware that the vehicle may be travelling quickly or may stop in a hurry.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2036',
        content: 'These signs apply only to tram drivers, but you should know their meaning so that you`re aware of the priorities and are able to anticipate the actions of the driver.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2037',
        content: 'The narrow wheels of a bicycle can become stuck in the tram rails, causing the cyclist to stop suddenly, wobble or even lose balance altogether. The tramlines are also slippery, which could cause a cyclist to slide or fall off.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2039',
        content: 'You mustn`t use your vehicle`s horn between 11.30 pm and 7 am in a built-up area or when you`re stationary, unless a moving vehicle poses a danger. Its function is to alert other road users to your presence.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2040',
        content: 'When you`re in a one-way street and want to turn right, you should take up a position in the right-hand lane. This will allow other road users, not wishing to turn, to pass on the left. Indicate your intention and take up the correct position in good time.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2041',
        content: 'If you wish to turn right into a side road, take up your position in good time. Move to the centre of the road when it`s safe to do so. This will allow vehicles to pass you on the left. Early planning will show other traffic what you intend to do.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2503',
        content: 'A toucan crossing is designed to allow pedestrians and cyclists to cross at the same time. Look out for cyclists approaching the crossing at speed.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2620',
        content: 'Don`t enforce the speed limit by blocking another vehicle`s progress. This will only cause frustration. Allow the other vehicle to pass when you can do so safely.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2643',
        content: 'You should only flash your headlights to warn others of your presence. Don`t use them to greet others, show impatience or give priority to other road users, because they could misunderstand your signal.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2644',
        content: 'Be cautious, especially when your view is restricted by hedges, bushes, walls, large vehicles, etc. In the summer months, these junctions can become more difficult to deal with, because growing foliage may further obscure your view.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2699',
        content: 'In good conditions, the `two-second rule` can be used to check the distance between your vehicle and the one in front. This technique works on roads carrying faster traffic. Choose a fixed object, such as a bridge, sign or tree. When the vehicle ahead passes this object, say to yourself `Only a fool breaks the two-second rule.` If you reach the object before you finish saying this, you`re too close.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2703',
        content: 'Puffin crossings have infra-red sensors that detect when pedestrians are crossing and hold the red traffic signal until the crossing is clear. The use of a sensor means there`s no flashing amber phase as there is with a pelican crossing.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2704',
        content: 'If the driver behind is following too closely, there`s a danger they`ll collide with the back of your vehicle if you stop suddenly. You can reduce this risk by slowing down and increasing the safety margin in front of you. This reduces the chance that you`ll have to stop suddenly and allows you to spread your braking over a greater distance. This is an example of defensive driving.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AB2956',
        content: 'When you meet oncoming vehicles on a single-track road, you should allow them to pass. You should pull into a passing place on your left or wait opposite a passing place on your right. Do not move onto the verge as there may be hidden hazards.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4012',
        content: 'Drive chains are subject to wear and need frequent adjustment to maintain the correct tension. Allowing the drive chain to run dry will greatly increase the rate of wear, so it`s important to keep it lubricated. If the chain becomes very worn and loose, it can jump off the sprocket and lock the rear wheel.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4014',
        content: 'Whenever you use any motorcycle on the road, it must be in a roadworthy condition. Regular maintenance should identify any faults at an early stage and help prevent more serious problems.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4018',
        content: 'New tyres have a shiny finish, which needs to wear off before the tyre will give the best grip. Take extra care if the road surface is wet or slippery.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4021',
        content: 'For your own safety, you need other road users to see you easily. Wearing brightly coloured or fluorescent clothing will help you to achieve this during daylight. At night, wearing clothing that includes reflective material is the best way of helping others to see you.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4022',
        content: 'Always wear your protective clothing, whatever the weather. In very hot weather it`s tempting to ride in light summer clothes, but it isn`t worth the risk. If you fall from your motorcycle, you`ll have no protection from the hard road surface. '
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4023',
        content: 'Motorcycles are smaller and therefore harder to see than most other vehicles on the road. You need to make yourself as visible as possible to other road users. Fluorescent and reflective clothing will help achieve this.'
    },
    {
        questionCode: 'AA4024',
        content: 'Fluorescent clothing will help others to see you during the day. At night, however, you should wear clothing that reflects the light. This allows other road users to see you more easily in their headlights. Ask your local motorcycle dealer about fluorescent and reflective clothing.'
